“Never give in. Never give in. Never, never, never, never—in nothing, great or small, large or petty—never give in, 
except to convictions of honour and good sense. 
Never yield to force. 
Never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.” 

― Winston S. Churchill, Never Give In!: The Best of Winston Churchill's Speeches
